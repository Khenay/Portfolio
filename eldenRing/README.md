# First MERN stack project | Full Stack

## Elden Ring web app.

Elden Ring is an openworld action RPG ( Role Playing Game) videogame by Japanese company FromSoftware. As such, it has many items to collect scattered all over the map and thoughout the playthrough. With this in mind, I had the idea of creating a Web App that helped keep track of all your items.

The app includes a non-geographic map of the game with some items marked on it, a register and login system, a password retrieval system that uses jwt, a ContactUs page that sends suggestions to the App email a profile page that keeps track of the user data and a pagination system for the items the user has collected.

The frontend was developed with React, the backend with Express.js and Node.js, the databases used were MongoDB and MySQL.

The project is divided in two folders (front and back) due to the amount of files (mainly because of the non-geographic map) I had to use for it.
