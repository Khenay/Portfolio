# Second roleplaying project | Full Back

## Planet express

By this point we already knew about databases, node.js, express and more backend technologies but we weren't yet ready for a Full Stack Web App so we used instead two view engines for the front end, EJS and Pug.

The project includes a map framework implementation, MongoDB and MySQL as databases (we used both for academic purposes) a proper register and login system with its adecuate backend routing, a pdf-creating framework used to generate invoices for our clients and more backend technologies.
