# Crews challenge | Full Stack Web App

## Emancipatic

The crews challenge was the final project of the bootcamp. In it, the different courses that The Bridge teaches(Full Stack Web Development, Ux/Ui, Data Science, Cyber Security and Marketing) join forces in order to create a full work environment experience. Each department provided the necessary input to develop the App.

Emancipatic is a NGO that seeks to connect people above a certain age threshold, who might be less inclined to use the internet, with the rest of the world. In our case we developed for them a Web App that makes it easier for the user to find people that can help them learn about how to use different technologies such as WhatsApp, FaceBook, Instagram or YouTube.
