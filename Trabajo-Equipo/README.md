# First role playing team project | Full Front


# Cine Paradiso

We were presented (by our teacher, playing the role of a client), with this project. It was a small family business, a movies theatre. It had 4 small screens, the user didn't have to login to buy the tickets but registered users could keep track of all the movies they had seen. Once registered, the user would be able to login in order to make use of all of their profile features. The app would have a listing page with all the available movies; while hovering over one of theese movies, a synopsis would show. We included a buying menu where we would ask the use for some data so that they could purchase their tickets.

The team was aware that an app suck as this one is usually made with the implementation of a databse and some backend technlogies, which we didn't know how to use at this point, so we made up for it with a lot of dedication and a lot of JavaScript (for a month of lessons without any previous experience).
